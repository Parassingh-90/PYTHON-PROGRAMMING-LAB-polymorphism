#### 1. Focus Area : Experimentation

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>understand the concept of polymorphism and give example. |understand | understand
2.| User will be able to: <br>apply the concept of polymorphism <br> and solve the problem. | apply | apply

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Problem Based
###### Assessment Method: Summative

<u> <b>Description: </b> of how you are going to implement the above Instructional Strategy in your Simulator: </u>
<br>
 Input the parameter values and compute the corresponding area and show logical explanation for the result produced.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to understand the concept of polymorphism  <br> and try to give example. |solve problem based on polymorphism | Define polymorphism
2.| User will be able to apply the concept of polymorphism  <br> and try to solve the problem . | to compute area of circle, square and triangle | 1 What is the biggest reason for the use of polymorphism <br> A. It allows the programmer to think at a more abstract level  <br> B. There is less program code to write <br> C. The program will have a more elegant design and will be easier to maintain and update <br> <b> D. Program code takes up less space  </b> <br>

#### 5. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will enter space separated  inputs.| Area of different shapes will be produced as output based on the number of inputs given. Logical explaination will also be given. | User will be able to have practical knowledge of function overloading.
